## Installation üöÄ
To install NaturalShell directly from its GitHub repository using pip, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/theghostrat/NaturalShell.git
```

This command will clone the repository and install the package along with its dependencies.

Alternatively, if you want to install it in editable mode, allowing you to make changes to the code and see the changes reflected immediately without reinstalling, you can use:

```bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/theghostrat/NaturalShell.git
```

This will install NaturalShell in editable mode, and any changes you make to the code will be reflected without needing to reinstall the package.

Both of these commands will fetch the latest version of NaturalShell from its GitHub repository and install it on your system.
